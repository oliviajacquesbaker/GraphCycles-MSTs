PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given an undirected graph, write an algorithm to find a cycle. You can not assume the graph is connected.
Given a sparse undirected graph (n nodes and at most n+8 edges), write an efficient algroithm to find the minimum spanning tree.

HOW TO RUN:
Either open the precreated .exe in this same folder, or rebuild the solution yourself if you wish. If so, the command is
g++ Graph.cpp Assignment1_JacquesBaker.cpp -o Assignment1.exe

EXTRA INFO:
The real meat and potatoes of this code is the Graph.cpp file; Assignment1_JacquesBaker.cpp is just the setup for the user
to interact with the rest of the code. Graph.cpp is where the problem statement is solved.
